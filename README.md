The Odin Project - Foundations - Recipes

This is a practice assignment intended to review basic HTML concepts as well as git commands:
	- HTML Boilerplate
	- Headers
	- Paragraph
	- List
	- Git commits

The project consists of a landing page that links to three recipe pages. The recipe pages themselves contain an image, description, an ingredients list, and instructions.
